trueapp can be used to upload patient's information to the database(information like allergies, aadhar, other health issues, age, dob,etc.)

in case of an emergency, if the patient isn't able to provide information regarding their allergies to the doctor(eg. unconsious), the doctor can access the database to view their medical history.
